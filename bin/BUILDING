					HOW TO COMPILE

To build this program in the root directory type "make all"
inside a terminal on linux, if using windows open a wsl windows
and in the root directory of this program type "make win"

To set up a server you are required to make an account info file
an account info file includes account UID's and account passwords
to make one you will need to create a file, it can be called
anything, I reccomend "accounts" after you create this file open
it up and the first thing you will enter will be an account UID
then an account password you can do that multiple times if you
are confused please take a look at the example below (please note
that account UID's can be anything (inside the 32-bit signed 
integer limit), but we reccomend starting at 10 and incrementing
by one every new account). Also take note that the accounts file
MUST end in a newline.

accounts
```
10
password
11
12345
12
password123

```

The user will then sign in with this UID and password this UID
is also used to direct message other users of Muskrat Mail. Users
can view others UID's with the "/ls" command inside of Muskrat 
Mail.
